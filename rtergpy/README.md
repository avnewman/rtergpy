## Install 
Once you're in the proper environment, for me it is done by:
``` 
conda activate rterg
```
Install by going into this directory `rtergpy` and using pip:
```
pip install .
```

If there are any dependencies needed, you may need to install these first.

----
## Setup
Before running any code, go into `rtergpy/run.py` and change the default event and library locations that correspond to your install.

----
## Run
Look in the `Examples` and `notebooks` for how to process.
